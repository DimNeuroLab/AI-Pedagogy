Invent unique terms and categories that sound plausible but are not borrowed from existing taxonomies.\n- Entity names should also be fully original.\n- The ontology must include shared patterns, with some overlap across entities, but remain diverse and internally consistent.\n\nReturn only valid JSON in this format:\n{\n  \"Entity1\": {\n    \"FeatureA\": \"...\",\n    \"FeatureB\": \"...\",\n    ...\n  },\n  ...\n}"
