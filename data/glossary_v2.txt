Loflo: Loflos are aquatic metallic-eaters with delicate wings that allow them to flutter through the water’s surface layers. They live in solitude, gliding between submerged metals and mineral deposits for sustenance.
Vorven: Vorvens are gelatinous desert dwellers that feed on metallic minerals. Their flexible bodies enable bounding movement across dunes, and they form close-knit communal clusters that shimmer under the sun.
Sylpho: Sylphos are feathered beings inhabiting crystal caverns. Herbivorous by nature, they swim elegantly through crystalline fluids, preferring isolation among radiant mineral pools.
Venrin: Venrins are phototrophic quadrupeds of the skies, bounding between air currents and feeding on sunlight. They thrive in communal flocks that drift high above the clouds.
Seltha: Selthas are furry forest creatures that consume trace metals from their environment. They crawl along tree trunks and roots in tight-knit communities, leaving metallic trails in their wake.
Seldra: Seldras are tentacled predators of the forest canopy, feeding on smaller creatures. They flutter silently through the undergrowth, living solitary lives among shadowed leaves.
Xpy: Xpies are metallic-bodied beings native to desert regions. They slide across dunes in communal formations, consuming metallic sands to sustain their gleaming exteriors.
Shavarcrys: Shavarcryses are petal-like phototrophs found in crystal habitats. They absorb light energy while swimming through reflective mineral pools, living in tranquil solitude.
Janzeph: Janzephs are feathered aerial carnivores that slide on air currents in pursuit of prey. They are solitary hunters, gliding in silence through the upper atmosphere.
Vapyx: Vapyxes are aquatic quadrupeds that feed on vegetation beneath the water’s surface. They crawl along seabeds in communal pods, maintaining harmony within their watery environments.
